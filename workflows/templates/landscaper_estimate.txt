SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm a landscaper writing an estimate for a specific landscaping service (cleanup, planting, mulching, lawn care, etc.).

Service Details:
Work Requested: {work_requested}
Property Conditions: {property_conditions}
Proposed Work: {proposed_work}
Materials/Plants: {materials}

Please write a clear landscaping estimate:

Tone: nature-focused, practical, helpful
Structure:
1. What you'd like done
2. What we'll do (specific tasks)
3. Materials and plants we'll use
4. Timeline and scheduling
5. Investment
6. Maintenance tips
7. Next steps

Keep it:
- Specific about what tasks are included
- Clear about plant selections and why they work
- Realistic about timing (weather-dependent)
- Helpful about ongoing care

Emphasize:
- Right plants for their conditions
- Quality of materials (mulch, soil, etc.)
- Professional installation
- Cleanup included
- Seasonal timing considerations

Include:
- Specific plant varieties and sizes
- Soil amendments or preparations
- Mulch or ground cover materials
- Cleanup and debris removal
- How weather might affect timing
- Basic care instructions

Avoid:
- Overpromising plant growth or results
- Selling plants that won't thrive in their conditions
- Unclear scope that leads to "while we're here" additions
