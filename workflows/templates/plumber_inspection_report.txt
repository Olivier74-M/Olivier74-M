SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm a plumber writing an inspection report after evaluating a property's plumbing system.

Inspection Details:
Property: {property_info}
System Age: {system_age}
Inspection Scope: {inspection_scope}
Findings: {findings}
Photos/Evidence: {evidence_notes}
Issues Identified: {issues}

Please write a detailed plumbing inspection report:

Tone: straightforward, honest, thorough
Structure:
1. Property overview and system age
2. Water supply system
   - Pipe materials and condition
   - Water pressure
   - Shut-off valves
   - Issues found
3. Drainage and waste system
   - Drain flow
   - Vent system
   - Issues found
4. Water heater assessment
   - Age, type, condition
   - Safety concerns
   - Performance
5. Fixtures and fittings
6. Visible leaks or moisture
7. Code compliance concerns
8. Recommendations prioritized by urgency

Keep it:
- Fact-based and objective
- Clear about severity of issues
- Honest about what needs attention now vs. later
- Helpful for planning

Emphasize:
- Active leaks (immediate issue)
- Safety concerns (gas, water heater, etc.)
- Code violations
- Age-related issues to plan for
- Hidden problems we found

Include:
- Specific observations and measurements
- Urgency level for each issue
- Consequences if not addressed
- Estimated lifespan of aging components
- Photos/evidence referenced

Avoid:
- Scare tactics
- Selling services
- Vague "might be a problem" statements
- Assuming problems we can't see

Format each finding with:
- Location and what we found
- Why it's a concern
- Urgency (immediate/soon/monitor/plan ahead)
- Typical cost range to address
