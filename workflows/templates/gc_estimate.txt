SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm a general contractor writing an estimate for a smaller renovation or repair project.

Project Details:
Work Requested: {work_requested}
Property Info: {property_info}
Scope of Work: {scope_of_work}
Timeline Estimate: {timeline}

Please write a professional GC estimate:

Tone: confident, organized, clear
Structure:
1. Understanding of what you want done
2. Scope of work overview
3. What's included (materials, labor, permits, etc.)
4. Timeline estimate
5. Investment breakdown
6. Next steps

Keep it:
- Well-organized and easy to understand
- Clear about what's in scope vs. out of scope
- Transparent about the process
- Focused on getting it done right

Emphasize:
- Experience with this type of work
- Quality of workmanship
- Project management and coordination
- Licensed and insured
- What's included in the price
- How we handle the unexpected

Include:
- Labor and materials breakdown
- Permits and inspections
- Timeline estimate
- Payment schedule
- How changes are handled
- Warranty information

Avoid:
- Overpromising on timeline
- Vague scope that leads to disputes
- Hidden costs or surprise fees
