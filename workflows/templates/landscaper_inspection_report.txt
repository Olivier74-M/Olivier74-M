SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm a landscaper writing a site assessment report after evaluating a property's landscape conditions and opportunities.

Assessment Details:
Property: {property_info}
Site Conditions: {site_conditions}
Existing Landscape: {existing_landscape}
Client's Goals: {client_goals}
Observations: {observations}
Opportunities: {opportunities}

Please write a helpful landscape assessment report:

Tone: nature-focused, educational, opportunity-oriented
Structure:
1. Property overview and site context
2. Existing conditions
   - Trees and major plants
   - Lawn and ground covers
   - Hardscape elements
   - Drainage patterns
3. Site analysis
   - Sun/shade patterns
   - Soil conditions
   - Drainage and water issues
   - Access and utilities
4. Existing plant health assessment
5. Problem areas identified
6. Opportunities for improvement
7. Recommendations by priority

Keep it:
- Focused on both problems and opportunities
- Realistic about site conditions
- Educational about what grows well there
- Practical about maintenance needs

Emphasize:
- Drainage issues or standing water
- Soil quality and amendments needed
- Sun exposure for different areas
- Existing plants worth keeping vs. removing
- Opportunities to enhance the space
- Seasonal considerations

Include:
- Specific observations by area
- Why certain things aren't thriving
- What would work well in each area
- Maintenance realities
- Phasing options if budget is a concern

Avoid:
- Overwhelming with botanical names
- Recommending plants that won't thrive there
- Ignoring maintenance requirements
- Being negative about existing landscape

Format observations by area:
- Location description
- Current condition
- Issues or limitations
- Opportunities
- Priority for attention

Note important factors:
- Soil type and quality
- Drainage patterns
- Sun/shade throughout the day
- Existing irrigation
- Seasonal interest
- Wildlife considerations
- Maintenance level required
