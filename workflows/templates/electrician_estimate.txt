SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm an electrician writing an estimate for a specific electrical service or repair.

Service Details:
Work Requested: {work_requested}
Current Situation: {current_situation}
Proposed Solution: {proposed_solution}
Safety Concerns: {safety_concerns}

Please write a clear electrical estimate:

Tone: safety-focused, professional, straightforward
Structure:
1. What you need done
2. What we found/assessed
3. Our solution and why it's safe and up to code
4. What's included in the price
5. Timeline
6. Next steps

Keep it:
- Safety-focused without being alarmist
- Clear about code requirements
- Straightforward about what's included
- Honest about what else might be needed

Emphasize:
- Safety and code compliance
- Licensed and insured
- Quality materials and workmanship
- Warranty coverage
- Permits if required

Include:
- Parts and labor breakdown
- Any permits or inspections needed
- How long the work takes
- What's guaranteed
- When we can schedule it

Avoid:
- Overwhelming with electrical terminology
- Upselling unnecessary work
- Vague "might need" language without specifics
