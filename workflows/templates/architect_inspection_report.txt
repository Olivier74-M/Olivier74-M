SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm an architect writing a site assessment report after evaluating a property for design opportunities and constraints.

Assessment Details:
Property: {property_info}
Property Type: {property_type}
Client's Vision: {client_vision}
Site Observations: {observations}
Design Opportunities: {opportunities}
Constraints: {constraints}

Please write a thoughtful architectural assessment report:

Tone: creative but analytical, opportunity-focused
Structure:
1. Property overview and context
2. Existing conditions
   - Building characteristics
   - Spatial layout
   - Architectural style
   - Structural observations
3. Site analysis
   - Orientation and views
   - Natural light
   - Circulation and flow
   - Relationship to outdoor spaces
4. Zoning and code considerations
5. Design opportunities identified
6. Constraints and challenges
7. Preliminary thoughts on approach
8. Recommendations for next steps

Keep it:
- Balanced between creative vision and practical realities
- Clear about opportunities and constraints
- Inspiring about what's possible
- Realistic about complexity and approvals

Emphasize:
- How the space could better serve their needs
- Natural light and views
- Flow and circulation issues
- Structural or code implications
- Unique characteristics worth preserving or highlighting
- Zoning or permitting considerations

Include:
- Observations about spatial quality
- How current layout does/doesn't work
- Opportunities for improvement
- Constraints (structural, code, budget reality)
- Preliminary design concepts if appropriate
- Need for specialist consultations

Avoid:
- Overpromising what's possible
- Ignoring budget or code realities
- Too much technical jargon
- Designing without understanding needs fully

Format observations by:
- Existing condition
- How it affects their goals
- Design opportunity
- Constraints to consider
- Priority/impact

Note when additional consultations needed:
- Structural engineer for load-bearing changes
- Soils engineer for foundation work
- Energy consultant for efficiency goals
- Historic preservation if applicable
- Zoning attorney for complex issues
- MEP engineers for major system changes

Consider:
- Building orientation and solar
- View corridors
- Natural ventilation
- Privacy
- Scale and proportion
- Character of neighborhood
- Future flexibility
