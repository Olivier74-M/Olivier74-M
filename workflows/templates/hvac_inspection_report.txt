SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm an HVAC technician writing a detailed inspection report after evaluating a heating and cooling system.

Inspection Details:
Property: {property_info}
System Age: {system_age}
Inspection Findings: {findings}
Photos/Evidence: {evidence_notes}
Safety Concerns: {safety_concerns}
Recommendations: {recommendations}

Please write a thorough HVAC inspection report:

Tone: objective, thorough, educational (not salesy)
Structure:
1. Property and system overview
2. Heating system assessment
   - Age and condition
   - Performance testing results
   - Issues found
3. Cooling system assessment
   - Age and condition
   - Performance testing results
   - Issues found
4. Air quality and ventilation
5. Safety concerns (if any)
6. Efficiency observations
7. Immediate needs vs. future considerations
8. Recommendations prioritized by urgency

Keep it:
- Objective and fact-based
- Clear about what's working vs. what's not
- Educational about what we found
- Helpful for decision-making

Emphasize:
- Safety issues (immediate attention)
- Efficiency problems (costing them money)
- Age-related wear (plan ahead)
- What's normal vs. concerning
- Photos/evidence of issues

Include:
- Specific measurements and observations
- Severity/urgency of each issue
- Expected lifespan of components
- Consequences of not addressing issues
- Recommended timeline for repairs/replacement

Avoid:
- Alarmist language
- Selling services (just report facts)
- Vague "might need" statements
- Technical jargon without explanation

Format each finding with:
- What we found
- Why it matters
- Urgency level (immediate/soon/plan ahead)
- Typical cost range if relevant
