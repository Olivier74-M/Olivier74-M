SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm an electrician writing an inspection report after evaluating a property's electrical system.

Inspection Details:
Property: {property_info}
System Age: {system_age}
Panel Info: {panel_info}
Inspection Findings: {findings}
Safety Concerns: {safety_concerns}
Code Issues: {code_issues}

Please write a thorough electrical inspection report:

Tone: safety-focused, clear, objective
Structure:
1. Property and electrical system overview
2. Main panel assessment
   - Age, type, capacity
   - Condition and labeling
   - Available capacity
   - Safety concerns
3. Branch circuits and wiring
   - Wiring types observed
   - Condition
   - Issues found
4. Grounding and bonding
5. GFCI/AFCI protection
6. Safety hazards identified
7. Code compliance issues
8. Recommendations prioritized by safety urgency

Keep it:
- Safety-focused without being alarmist
- Clear about what's dangerous vs. what's outdated
- Objective and evidence-based
- Educational about electrical safety

Emphasize:
- Immediate safety hazards
- Code violations
- Lack of required protection (GFCI/AFCI)
- Capacity issues
- Fire hazards
- Shock hazards

Include:
- Specific findings with locations
- Severity and urgency of each issue
- Current code requirements
- Consequences of not addressing issues
- Recommended timeline for corrections

Avoid:
- Overstating minor issues
- Assuming hidden problems without evidence
- Selling services (report facts only)
- Technical jargon without explanation

Format each finding with:
- Location and specific observation
- Safety concern or code reference
- Urgency level (immediate/high/moderate/low)
- Recommended correction
- Typical cost range if helpful

Priority levels:
- IMMEDIATE: Active hazard, safety risk
- HIGH: Code violation, potential hazard
- MODERATE: Outdated but functional, plan upgrade
- LOW: Improvement opportunity, not required
