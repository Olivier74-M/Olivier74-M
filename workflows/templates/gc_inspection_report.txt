Please write a comprehensive property inspection report:

Tone: professional, thorough, practical
Structure:
1. Property overview and inspection scope
2. Structural observations
   - Foundation
   - Framing
   - Roof structure
   - Concerns found

   - Windows and doors
   - Roof covering
   - Gutters and drainage
4. Interior condition
   - Walls and ceilings
   - Floors
   - Doors and trim
   - Moisture issues
5. Systems overview (if applicable)
   - Brief notes on HVAC, plumbing, electrical
   - Recommend specialist inspections
6. Priority findings and recommendations
7. Scope of work considerations

Keep it:
- Organized by area/system
- Clear about what's cosmetic vs. structural
- Practical about repair vs. replace decisions
- Focused on helping them plan

Emphasize:
- Structural or safety issues
- Water damage or moisture problems

- Issues requiring specialist evaluation

Include:
- Specific locations and observations
- Severity of each issue
- Whether it affects their project goals
- Ballpark complexity/cost if helpful

- Promising exact pricing
- Scope creep beyond what was discussed

Format findings by:
- Area/system
- Observation
- Impact on project
- Urgency/priority
- Recommended action

Note when specialist evaluation is recommended:
- Structural engineer for foundation/framing concerns
