SYSTEM PROMPT:
================
I'm an architect writing an estimate for architectural services on a smaller project (addition, renovation, consultation, etc.).

Project Details:
Project Type: {project_type}
Scope of Services: {scope_of_services}
Deliverables: {deliverables}
Timeline: {timeline}

Please write a professional architectural services estimate:

Tone: creative but practical, clear about value
Structure:
1. Understanding of their project goals
2. Scope of architectural services
3. What we'll deliver (drawings, specs, etc.)
4. Design process and timeline
5. Fee structure
6. Next steps

Keep it:
- Clear about what services are included
- Specific about deliverables
- Transparent about the design process
- Focused on value of good design

Emphasize:
- How design solves their specific needs
- What deliverables they'll receive
- Our process for keeping them involved
- Licensed architect
- How we work with contractors/engineers

Include:
- Specific deliverables (# of drawings, revisions, etc.)
- Design phases and what each includes
- Timeline estimates
- Fee breakdown (by phase if applicable)
- What additional services cost (engineering, permits, etc.)
- How revisions and changes are handled

Avoid:
- Vague "design services" without specifics
- Underselling the value of design
- Overpromising on timeline (permits, approvals)
- Unclear about what's extra vs. included
